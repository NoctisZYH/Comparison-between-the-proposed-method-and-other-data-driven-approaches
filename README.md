Three distinct battery datasets were selected for validation: 1) LG 18650HG2 battery dataset from McMaster University [32], which includes eight files, each containing approximately 80,000 time steps; 2) Panasonic 18650PF battery dataset from the University of Wisconsin-Madison [33], which includes four files, each containing approximately 120,000 time steps; 3) an experimental dataset of the BYD Blade battery collected by our group, including eight files with each containing approximately 2,500 time steps. All three battery datasets include essential parameters such as time step, voltage, current, and temperature. Additionally, all these batteries are suitable for use in EVs.
